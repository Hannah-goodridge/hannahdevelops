> ## Some part of me knew that from the age of 5, when I got my first lego set, I had the makings of an engineer.

Ever since I was a little girl playing with my first Lego set, I've been driven by a passion for building things. I vividly remember trying to build the ultimate flying car, obsessing over every little detail. That same focus and determination have guided my entire career.

From Lego and Meccano to teaching myself guitar and conquering digital worlds on PlayStation, I was always creating. After finishing my design degree, I found myself frustrated by the inability to bring my digital visions to life. So, naturally, I set out to learn how to code, landing an apprenticeship where I honed my skills. That was back in 2012, and I've been on this wild ride ever since.

### The Professional Journey

Entering the world of frontend development was like diving into the deep end, but I embraced the challenge. In the early days, I used to think not knowing every programming language was a weakness. I've since learned that true expertise comes from deep focus and continuous learning, not just a long list of languages.

Today, with over a decade of experience, I specialize in creating robust, scalable, and beautiful user interfaces. I currently work as a **Frontend Developer at MoneyHub**, a fintech company based in Bristol. A significant part of my role involves building and maintaining their design system, ensuring consistency and efficiency across all of our digital products. It's a role that perfectly blends my passion for meticulous engineering with my love for elegant design.

### Life Beyond the Code

When I'm not immersed in components and code, you'll find me exploring new recipes in the kitchen, strumming my guitar, or getting lost in the world of gaming. Nature is my sanctuary; there's nothing like a long hike or a bike ride through the countryside to recharge my batteries.

On a more personal note, I'm a proud introvert and a devoted cat parent. I'm always on the lookout for new experiences and knowledge—because in the tech world, standing still means falling behind.

### Let's Build Something Together

Thank you for taking the time to read my story. If you have a project in mind, want to talk about design systems, or just want to say hello, I'd love to hear from you.
