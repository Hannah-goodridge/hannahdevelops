> ## Some part of me knew that from the age of 5, when I got my first lego set, I had the makings of an engineer.

Ever since I was a little girl playing with my first Lego set at the tender age of 5, I had this inkling that I was meant for engineering. I vividly remember trying to build the ultimate flying car from scratch, obsessing over every little detail from the wheels to the car seat. It was like my own little mission to conquer the world, one Lego brick at a time. Little did I know, that was just the beginning of my quest for perfection.

From Legos to Meccano, from teaching myself guitar to defeating digital foes on PlayStation, I was always tinkering and creating in one way or another. Fast forward to after I finished my design degree, and I found myself frustrated that I couldn't whip up a website from thin air. So, naturally, I set out to learn how to code, eventually landing an apprenticeship where I honed my skills crafting websites and email campaigns. That was back in 2012, and I've been on this wild ride ever since.

Entering the world of Frontend development was like diving into the deep end of a pool for the first time. It was overwhelming, to say the least. But with the same determination I had as a kid building flying cars, I pushed through and got the hang of it.

In the early days, I used to think not knowing every programming language made me a subpar developer. But hey, trial and error taught me otherwise. Sometimes you just gotta dive in headfirst and figure it out along the way.

Now, with over a decade of experience under my belt, I'm confident in my skills. I've built all sorts of websites and apps, from microsites to full-blown applications. Lately, I've been geeking out over React.js, Gatsby.js, Tailwind.css, and GraphQL – you might notice those are the tech tools I used to put together this website.



– Hobbies

When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll find me exploring new flavors in the kitchen (even if I'm not exactly a chef), strumming away on my guitar, or getting lost in the world of gaming. And nature? Oh, it's my happy place. There's nothing like a long hike or a bike ride through the countryside to recharge my batteries.

– Personal

On a more personal note, I'm a proud introvert and a devoted cat parent. I'm always on the lookout for new experiences and knowledge because let's face it, the tech world never stops evolving.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story.
