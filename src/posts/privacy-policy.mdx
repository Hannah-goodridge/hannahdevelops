Hello! I'm Hannah Goodridge, and this is my personal website and blog. Your privacy is important to me. This policy explains what information I collect and how I use it. It's written to be as clear and simple as possible.

## My Approach to Privacy

I believe in being transparent and collecting only the minimum amount of data necessary to run this site and understand its performance. I am the only person who has access to this data.

## Information I Collect

### Website Analytics

Like most websites, I use analytics to understand how visitors engage with my site. This helps me see which content is popular and how I can improve the user experience. This information is processed in a way that does not directly identify anyone. It may include:

*   The pages you visit
*   The time you spend on each page
*   The type of device and browser you are using
*   Your general geographic location (e.g., country or city)

### Like/Dislike Counter

My blog posts have a feature that allows you to "like" or "dislike" them. When you click the like or dislike button, I record that action to keep a running total for each post. This process is completely anonymous. I do not collect any personal information, IP addresses, or use cookies to track your individual votes. The sole purpose is to see which posts are most helpful or interesting to readers.

### Cookies

This site uses a minimal number of cookies to function correctly and improve your experience. Cookies are small text files stored on your device. Specifically, I use them for:

*   **Theme Preferences:** To remember your choice between light and dark mode on subsequent visits.
*   **Analytics:** To help me gather the anonymous usage data described above.

You can control or delete cookies through your browser settings at any time.

## How I Use Your Information

The anonymous data I collect is used solely for the following purposes:

*   To operate and maintain my website.
*   To improve the content and user experience.
*   To understand trends in website traffic and content popularity.

I will never sell, rent, or share this information with third parties for marketing purposes.

## Data Storage and Security

The anonymous like/dislike counts are stored in a Firebase Realtime Database, which is a secure service provided by Google. I take reasonable steps to protect the information I collect, but please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

## Links to Other Websites

My website may contain links to other websites that I do not operate. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. I strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit, as I have no control over and assume no responsibility for their content or practices.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top.

## Contact Me

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to get in touch with me. You can reach me by email [here](mailto:&#104;&#97;&#110;&#110;&#97;&#104;&#103;&#111;&#111;&#100;&#114;&#105;&#100;&#103;&#101;&#64;&#111;&#117;&#116;&#108;&#111;&#111;&#107;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;).
