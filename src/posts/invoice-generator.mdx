# A Truly Free Invoice Generator - No Strings Attached

After spending hours searching for a simple invoice generator that didn't require subscriptions, hide features behind paywalls, or harvest data, I decided to build my own solution.

[Try the Invoice Generator now!](/invoice-generator/)

## Why Another Invoice Generator?

Most "free" invoice generators I found either:
- Limited the number of invoices you could create
- Required payment for basic features like PDF export
- Collected and stored your business data
- Bombarded you with ads and upsells

I wanted something different: a straightforward, professional tool that respects your privacy and actually delivers on the promise of being free.

- **Privacy First**: Works entirely in your browser - no data collection or storage
- **No Account Required**: Just open and start creating invoices
- **Professional Exports**: Generate clean, professional PDFs and CSVs
- **Customizable**: Adapt the design to match your brand
- **Open Source**: Transparent code you can verify and trust

## Features That Matter

- Professional PDF generation
- CSV export for accounting software
- Custom branding and colors
- Multiple currency support
- VAT calculations
- Company logo upload
- Digital signature support
- Clean, professional design

## How to Use It

1. [Visit the Invoice Generator](/invoice-generator/)
2. Fill in your business and client details
3. Add your invoice items
4. Customize the design if desired
5. Export to PDF or CSV
6. That's it - no sign-up, no tracking
